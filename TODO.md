# Installer TODO List

The project contains multiple scripts and helper files. The following issues were observed and should be addressed to make the installer usable and maintainable.

## User-friendly app
- ~~Convert the installer into a Node.js or Python application with a command-line interface.~~
- Automatically install required dependencies (npm modules or pip packages) if missing.
- Provide a single script that handles mod downloads and launches VRChat.
- Move the hard coded mod list from `index.js` into a separate configuration file for easier maintenance.
